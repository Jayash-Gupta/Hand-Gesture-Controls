                                                              libraries and packages used
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 open cv:
 OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time 
 operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting
 of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. 
 To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features.


 mediapipe:
---> Mediapipe is a cross-platform library developed by Google that provides amazing
     ready-to-use ML solutions for computer vision tasks.
--->OpenCV library in python is a computer vision library that is widely used for
    image analysis, image processing, detection, recognition, etc.


 ctypes:
 Ctypes modules are foreign function libraries that provide C-compatible data types and allow the calling functions in shared libraries or dynamic
 link libraries. In a foreign function library, the Python code will call C functions using only Python, without any special or custom-made extensions.
 Ctypes modules are the most powerful library available for Python developers. They enable you to call functions in dynamically interlinked libraries 
 and use them for low-level memory manipulations.


 comtypes: package of ctypes
 comtypes is a pure Python COM package based on the ctypes ffi foreign function library.
 The comtypes package makes it easy to access and implement both custom and dispatch based COM interfaces.


pycaw:
python core audio windows library


numpy: numeric python
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.


sbc: screen_brightness_control
A Python tool for controlling the brightness of your monitor. Supports Windows and most flavours of Linux.


pyautogui:
PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. The API is designed to be simple.
PyAutoGUI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and runs on Python 2 and 3.


os:
Python OS module provides the facility to establish the interaction between the user and the operating system. It offers many useful OS functions
that are used to perform OS-based tasks and get related information about operating system. The OS comes under Python's standard utility modules.
